#
# this option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server.
# This can be used for several purposes.
# The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX box
# uses.
# The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share files.
#
# Please note that for user mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user
# credentials.
#
# Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been successfully
# authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified entries in the map table
# (e.g. biddle = DOMAIN\foo).
#
# The map file is parsed line by line. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left
# then a '=' followed by a list of usernames on the right. The list of usernames on the right may
# contain names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group.
# The special client name '*' is a wildcard and matches any name.
# Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long.
#
# The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each
# username on the right hand side of the '=' signs.
# If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the
# name on the left. Processing then continues with the next line.
#
# If any line begins with a '#' or a ';' then it is ignored.
#
# If any line begins with an '!' then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done
# by the line.
# Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed. Using '!' is most useful when you have
# a wildcard mapping line later in the file.
#
# For example to map from the name admin or administrator to the UNIX name root you would use:
root = admin administrator
#
# Or to map anyone in the UNIX group system to the UNIX name sys you would use:
#
sys = @system
#
# You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file.
#
# If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then the netgroup database is checked before the /etc/group
# database for matching groups.
#
# You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double quotes around the name.
# For example:
tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"
# would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the unix username "tridge".
#
# The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys, and map the rest to guest.
# Note the use of the '!' to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on that line:
#
!sys = mary fred
guest = *
#
# Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of usernames. Thus if you connect to \\server\fred
# and fred is remapped to mary then you will actually be connecting to \\server\mary and will need to
# supply a password suitable for mary not fred.
# The only exception to this is the username passed to a Domain Controller (if you have one).
# The DC will receive whatever username the client supplies without modification.
#
# Also note that no reverse mapping is done. The main effect this has is with printing.
# Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think
# they don't own the print job.
#
# Samba versions prior to 3.0.8 would only support reading the fully qualified username (e.g.: DOMAIN\user)
# from the username map when performing a kerberos login from a client.
# However, when looking up a map entry for a user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would
# be used for matches. This resulted in inconsistent behavior sometimes even on the same server.
#
# The following functionality is obeyed in version 3.0.8 and later:
#
# When performing local authentication, the username map is applied to the login name before attempting to
# authenticate the connection.
#
# When relying upon a external domain controller for validating authentication requests,
# smbd will apply the username map to the fully qualified username (i.e. DOMAIN\user)
# only after the user has been successfully authenticated.
